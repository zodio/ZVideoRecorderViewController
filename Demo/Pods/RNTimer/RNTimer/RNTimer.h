/** Simple GCD-based timer based on NSTimer.

 Starts immediately and stops when deallocated. This avoids many of the typical problems with NSTimer:

 * RNTimer runs in all modes (unlike NSTimer)
 * RNTimer runs when there is no runloop (unlike NSTimer)
 * Repeating RNTimers can easily avoid retain loops (unlike NSTimer)

 After `seconds` seconds have elapsed, the timer fires, executing the block.
 You will generally need to use a weakSelf pointer to avoid a retain loop.
